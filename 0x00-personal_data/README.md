# How to implement a log filter that will obfuscate PII fields
## What is Log Filtering?
The process of modifying logs to protect this sensitive information.

### How to Obfuscate PII Fields:
Obfuscation means hiding or masking the actual data. Like replacing an email or password with "***".   

### Steps to Implement a Log Filter:
**1- Identify PII Fields:** Determine which fields contain PII (like email, password).
**2- Apply Regex or Similar Techniques:** Use regular expressions (regex) or specific algorithms to find and replace sensitive information in the logs.
**3- Substitute the PII:** Replace the actual values with a placeholder like *** or REDACTED.
